# Setup

```{r}
library(fpp3)
library(tidymodels)
library(skimr)
library(readr)

datPath <- 'D:/Courses/ForecastingBook/Forecasting Principals-Methods/Data/'
elecCons <- read_csv('D:/Courses/ForecastingBook/Forecasting Principals-Methods/Data/ElecCons.csv')
```

Recast electricity consumption data as a tsibble
```{r}
elecCons %>% glimpse()
```
```{r}
elec_cons <- elecCons %>% 
  select(dtime, Year, Month, day_of_month, Hour, dayName, weekend, season, tempK, irradiance_toa, cloud_cover, Elec_Cons) %>%
  filter(!are_duplicated(elecCons, index = dtime, key = Year)) %>%
  as_tsibble(key = Year, index = dtime)

elec_cons13 <- elec_cons %>% filter(Year == 2013)
```

# Introduction

Typically we think of time series as composed of three components:

* Trend-Cycle
* Seasonal
* Remainder

# Transformations and Adjustments

Transformations can simplify a time series by removing known sources of variation

## Calendar Trasformations

These effects can be removed by transforming the data. Take monthly sales in a retail establishment. Some variation will simply be due to the fact that certain months have more days. Could use average sales per day by month instead of total monthly sales.

## Population Adjustments

For data processes that are impacted by population dynamics it is best to use per-capita adjustments.

```{r}
global_economy %>%
  filter(Country == "Australia") %>%
  autoplot(GDP/Population) +
  labs(title = "GDP Per Capita")
```
## Inflation Adjustments

index_by is similar to group_by and can be used to re index and summaries a tsibble

```{r}
print_retail <- aus_retail %>%
  filter(Industry == "Newspaper and book retailing") %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  index_by(Year = year(Month)) %>%
  summarise(Turnover = sum(Turnover))
  
```
```{r}
aus_economy <- global_economy %>% filter(Code == "AUS")
```
The use of pivot_longer to pivot selected columns is a nice little tool fo the box

```{r}
print_retail %>%
  left_join(aus_economy, by = "Year") %>%
  mutate(Adjusted_Turnover = Turnover / CPI * 100) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(Turnover, Adjusted_Turnover), values_to = "Turnover") %>%
  mutate(name = factor(name, levels = c("Turnover", "Adjusted_Turnover"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, Turnover)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(name ~ ., scales = "free_y")
  
```
## Mathematical Transformations

These transformations are useful if the process is dependent on the absolue magnitude of the series
The Box-Cox transformation is useful for transforming highly skewed data, while leaving the central values of the data fairly stable.

The block of code automaticaly selects lambda using features and a metric. Features appear to add predefined metrics to a dataset.
Let's See. Pull extracts a single column by position or name. The feature method below looks up a scalar based on a range of values.
Pull makes it just a value.

```{r}
lambda <- aus_production %>%
  features(Gas, features = guerrero) %>%
  pull(lambda_guerrero)
lambda
```
```{r}
aus_production %>%
  autoplot(box_cox(Gas, lambda)) 
```

# Time Series Components

It is important to consider if the magnitude of seasonal flux or variation around the trend cycle varies with the magnitude of the series.
If this is the case a multiplicative transform is a better approach.

## Motivating Example: US Employment

```{r}
us_retail <- us_employment %>%
  filter(year(Month) >= 1990, Title == "Retail Trade") %>%
  select(-Series_ID)
autoplot(us_retail, Employed)
```
Calculate Decomposition. The output of the modeling step is a data stucture called a mable. A model table.

```{r}
dcmp <- us_retail %>%
  model(stl = STL(Employed))
  components(dcmp)
```

Trend Plot

```{r}
components(dcmp) %>% 
  as_tsibble() %>%
  autoplot(Employed, color = "grey") +
  geom_line(aes(y = trend), color = "orange")
```
Looking at the Components

```{r}
components(dcmp) %>% autoplot()
```
## Seasonally Adjusted Data

The decomposition method also produces a column for seasonal adjustment

```{r}
components(dcmp) %>% 
  as_tsibble() %>%
  autoplot(Employed, color = "grey") +
  geom_line(aes(y = season_adjust), color = "orange")
```
## Moving Averages

Early methods in decomposition focused on creating moving averages to capture the trend-cycle component.
Key paramaters:

MA order m:
k = periods relative to t
m = 2k + 1
k = m - 1 / 2

## Moving Average Smoothing

We use the slider package to calculate MA in the following code block.
The package is inspired by purrr map and other time based packages

```{r}
aus_exports <- global_economy %>%
  filter(Country == "Australia") %>%
  mutate(MA5 = slider::slide_dbl(Exports, mean, .before = 2, .after = 2, .complete = TRUE))

aus_exports %>% 
  autoplot(Exports) +
  geom_line(aes(y = MA5), color = "orange")
```
# Classical Decoposition

Key forms:

* Additive
* Multiplicative

m is commonly used to refer to the seasonality
* m-4: quarterly
* m-12: monthly

The first step in these type of analysis is performing a 2 x m MA to get at the trend component.
This method has been replaced by more advanced techniques.

# Methods used by Statistical Agencies

## X-11 Method

* trend-cycle available at end points
* Seasonal component is allowed to vary over time
* handles know date features

```{r}
library(seasonal)

x11_decomp <- us_retail %>%
  model(x11 = X_13ARIMA_SEATS(Employed ~ x11())) %>% 
  components()
autoplot(x11_decomp) +
  labs(title = "X11 Decomposition")
```
Seasonal adjustment plot. The code is a good example of how to manually create a legend and colors.

```{r}
x11_decomp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Employed, colour = "Data")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = season_adjust, colour = "Seasonally Adjusted")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = trend, colour = "Trend")) +
  scale_colour_manual(
    values = c("gray", "#0072B2", "#D55E00"),
    breaks = c("Data", "Seasonally Adjusted", "Trend")
  )
```
A Seasonal sub-series plot

```{r}
x11_decomp %>%
  gg_subseries(seasonal)
```
## STL Decomposition

STL: Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using LOESS

Advantage over X11:
* capable of handling any seasonality periodicity
* seasonal component can be non-stationary and controlled by user
* smoothness of trend can be controlled
* robust to outliers

```{r}
us_retail %>%
  model(
    STL(
      Employed ~ trend(window = 7) + season(window = "periodic"),
      robust = TRUE
    )
  ) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot()
```
